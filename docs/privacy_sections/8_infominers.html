    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or market personal information from children under 18, nor do we sell such information. By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of a minor who has provided consent. If we discover personal information from a child under 18, we will deactivate the account and take steps to delete the data.
