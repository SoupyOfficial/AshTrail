        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature that signals your privacy preference not to have your online browsing monitored. There is no universal standard for implementing DNT signals, so we do not currently respond to them. If a standard is adopted in the future, we will update our practices accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          California law requires us to inform you how we respond to DNT signals; however, since there is no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring these signals, we do not currently respond to them.
